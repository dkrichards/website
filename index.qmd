I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions (CASAA)](https://casaa.unm.edu/) at the [University of New Mexico](http://www.unm.edu/) supported by an individual training grant ([F32](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/yvxjHjGicUK1aVnDHo7z3w/project-details/10460643)) from the [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/). My research examines the motivational processes underlying engagement and change in harm reduction behaviors for alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs. The goal of my research is to inform intervention to alleviate suffering due to hazardous substance use. Prior to joining CASAA, I received my Ph.D. in health psychology (2020) from the [University of Texas at El Paso](https://utep.edu/) and B.S. in psychology (2014) from [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/).
